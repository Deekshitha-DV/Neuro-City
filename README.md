AI-Driven traffic management system using Azure services
Traffic Management System with Azure Integration

This project is a *real-time traffic management system* that leverages Azure services for vehicle detection, data storage, and IoT communication. It uses Azure Computer Vision, Data Lake Storage, and IoT Hub to analyze traffic density, store data, and control traffic signals dynamically.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using Azure Computer Vision
- Data storage in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- IoT Hub integration for telemetry data
- Dynamic traffic signal control based on vehicle count
- Error handling and logging for robust operation
