**The system consists of three main components:**

EmergencyVehicleDetector: Handles the detection of emergency vehicles using:

Computer vision model for visual identification
Audio processing for siren detection


**TrafficSignalController: Manages traffic signal timing and prioritization:**

Maintains a regular cycle for normal traffic flow
Overrides the cycle when emergency vehicles are detected
Provides real-time signal status updates


**EmergencyVehicleTrafficSystem: Integrates the detector and controller:**

Processes video feeds
Reports detections to the controller
Provides visualization for monitoring
